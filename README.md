## r/Place 2022 Data Analysis & Visulization

Once (hopefully) the data logs are released, I will be aiming to answers like the ones below:

- What would the board look like if it was only the first placements?
- What placement was the longest lived?
- What placement was the shortest lived?
- Average color per pixel
- First pixels in each expansion
- Heatmap between Purdue and Ireland
- Purdue vs Ireland upclose time-lapse
